		<p> The world's first photograph—or at least the oldest surviving photo—was taken by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 or 1827. Captured using a 
			technique known as heliography, the shot was taken from an upstairs window at Niépce's estate in Burgundy. 
		</p>
	    <p>Robert Cornelius's 1839 is the first self-portrait. Taken in Philadelphia</p>
	    <p>Louis Daguerre—the inventor of the daguerreotype—shot what is not only the world's oldest photograph of Paris, but also the first photo with humans.
		    The 10-minute-long exposure was taken in 1839 in Place de la République and it's just possible to make out two blurry figures in the left-hand 
		    corner.</p>
	  	<p>Daguerreotype by John W. Draper from 1840 is the first photo of the moon. Taken from his rooftop observatory at New York University, the image 
			has since sustained extensive damage.</p>
	    <p>Five years after the first photo of the moon, in 1845, French physicists Louis Fizeau and Leon Foucault took the first photograph of the sun.</p>
	    <p>On August 23, 1966, a lunar orbiter snapped this image of Earth from the Moon. The incredible image was captured during the orbiter's 16th lap
		    around the Moon.</p>
	    <p>Physicist James Clerk Maxwell is responsible for taking the world's first color photograph. In 1855, Maxwell developed a three-color method,
		    with the actual shutter being pressed by Thomas Sutton in 1861. </p>
	    <p>In 1926 National Geographic photographer Charles Martin and botanist William Longley took the first underwater photograph in color. </p>
	    <p>The first digital photo was taken in 1957, the image of Russell Kirsch's son was taken. The photo is a digital scan of a film image.</p>
	    <p>In April 2019, NASA released the first known image of a black hole. This mysterious entity sits in the center of the Messier 87 galaxy—55 
		    million light years from Earth—and was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope.</p>

	<p>The creation of photos relies on an "exposure triangle" that is managed by three key settings.
	 <p>The speed at which the shutter closes, known as the shutter speed, influences the duration of the exposure and enables photographers to capture
		 motion effectively. 
	 </p>
	 <p> ISO is a measure of the light sensitivity of film or a digital camera's sensor, which photographers alter to suit their surroundings.
	 </p>
	  <p> The aperture refers to the adjustable opening in the lens that governs the amount of light that enters the camera and affects the depth of field. 
		  It is crucial to master the adjustment of these three settings based on the location and subject to achieve excellent exposures.</p>
